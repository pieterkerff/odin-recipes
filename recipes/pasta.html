    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic italian dish. Altough daunting to get right, the steps itself are not that difficult!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>200g spaghetti</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>60g of Pecorino Romano</li>
      <li>100g of guanciale strips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the pasta for as long as the package says, don't forget to add a generous amount of salt to it!</li>
      <li>Put a pan on medium heat and add the guanciale. the fat in the meat will be enough to cook in, if not add a little bit of olive oil.</li>
      <li>In a bowl put 2 egg yolks and 1 hole egg and beat them together, add cheese and a generous amount of pepper. If the mixture is too thick you can add some pasta water.</li>
      <li>Once the pasta is done cooking, add it to the guanciale, stir a bit and then add the egg-cheese mix. Mix this quickly! if its still too thick add little bits of pasta water until right.</li>
    </ol>
