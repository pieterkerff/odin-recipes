This is the recipes project from TOP.
In here I will use everything I learned up until now to make build a basic recipe website.

It will have a landing page (index.html) which will have a couple of links to some recipes.
Currently it will only have HTML code.

I finished it!
It was more fun than I anticipated, so thats a relief! Not that I thought it would be difficult or anything, but I thought it would be boring.
I did get some really nice fundamentals down i think and that might be te most important lesson here.
